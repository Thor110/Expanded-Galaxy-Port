change text highlight to yellow to match the original game?


change 001ebo for the port to 001end

removing it from the file swaps which will require editing and recompiling HoloPatcher

this way the port .exe edits can be altered to contain 001end instead of 001ebo

as such there will be less file renaming/swapping

the less the better



update HoloPatcher/PortInstaller to have another dropdown for the namespaces
