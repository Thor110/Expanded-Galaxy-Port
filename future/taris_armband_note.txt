Expanded Galaxy Port Installer\tslpatchdata\Modules\tar_m02ac.mod

NOTE : do this later

modules\02 Taris\tar_m02ac [UPPER CITY SOUTH]\items\taris_armband.uti
modules\02 Taris\tar_m02ac.mod

is actually in tar_m02af on first exit ( I did this to avoid adding a new global, I think )

NOTE : Taris armband, could be removed from override altogether if it exists in this module.

Removing it caused a random crash during the cutscene, this doesn't make sense...

Also...........

Can eject NPCs from the map...
