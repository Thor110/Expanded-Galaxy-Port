change all strings referenced in ambientmusic.2da to match the filename?



use those strings to remove files from music that must be copied over?

tracks 12/13/14 are identical

entry 60+61 use strings already used

check 63 onwards

TSL Track Names are missing from the port dialog.tlk file? While not a problem, I am wondering why.
