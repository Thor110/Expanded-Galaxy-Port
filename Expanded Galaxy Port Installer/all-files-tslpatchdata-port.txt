Override ( no .nss files or .2da files ) - except includes ( k_inc_ *.nss )

.nss files go into the "source" folder, alongside this file.
EXCEPT any scripts named "k_inc_*.nss" * for anything, as these are include scripts and their source is required.

unmodified .2da files are present in the tslpatchdata folder for PyKotOR or TSLPatcher to compare against the changes.ini
