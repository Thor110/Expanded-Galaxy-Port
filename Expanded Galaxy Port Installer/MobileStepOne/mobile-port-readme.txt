4 : https://github.com/Thor110/Expanded-Galaxy-Main

5 : Then copy in the files from the "MobileStepOne" folder.

6 : Install the port project to the Mobile folder.

7 : Then copy in the files from the "MobileStepTwo" folder.

Now you can copy it across to the mobile device ( Android or iOS )



	To install for iOS

Install to this directory, then copy everything over using iTunes.

On iOS, they are placed in iTunes > Apps > Documents, in the same spot that the ‘saves’ folder goes.



	Optional Add-Ons

If you plan to install the Port or Brotherhood, the installation can be continued using this folder.

Note : there is no way to swap between playing K1 or K2 on mobile yet, so once you have installed the port, you are stuck with it.
