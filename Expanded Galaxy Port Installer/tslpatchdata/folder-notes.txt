Trying to keep a record of what files in the tslpatchdata are intended for

This is so that files that are identical across versions don't end up duplicated across the various folders

specifically GUI folders, but it may occur elsewhere




	AllDiffUI

UI files that are different in someway across versions

for all versions except android/ios
uibit_brdr_map_p.tga

	AllUI

UI files shared by all versions of the game

	Amazon

Amazon EXE

	Android

Android/iOS UI

	Disc

Disc EXE

	LegacyPC

For the LegacyPC EXE when error code 51 is resolved

	lips

lips files - localization.mod

	Modules

mod level files

	Override

override files

	Steam

Steam EXE

	SteamUI

Aspyr Specific UI files

four .gui files still need updating to be blue
custpnl_p.gui is done

	StreamVoice

Voice Files

	Xbox

Xbox XBE

	XboxGUI

Xbox specific GUI files

Currently this folder just contains everything necessary to change the Xbox GUI to KotOR Blue

It definitely contains duplicate files that exist in the Override folder

These files are also above the regular resolution of the original Xbox

So it will be necessary to extract and recolour the smaller versions from the Xbox version of the game at some point
