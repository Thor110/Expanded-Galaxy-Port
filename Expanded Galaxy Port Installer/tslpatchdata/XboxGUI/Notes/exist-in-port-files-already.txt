loadscreen3.tga
load_001ebo.tga
load_default.tga
pnl_datapad.tga
uibit_slider.tga
uibit_slider_p.tga
uibit_slider2.tga
uibit_slider2_p.tga

these four files exist in the port files already at the same resolution and similar filesizes or less ( smaller filesize on some )

as do the rest of the tga files in the "XboxGUI" folder

those that don't or are at a different resolution are in the "New" folder

These all need packing as TPC then the extension changing to TXB
