these four files exist in the port files already at the same resolution and similar filesizes or less ( smaller filesize on some )

as do the rest of the tga files in the "XboxGUI" folder

those that don't or are at a different resolution are in the "New" folder

the following four files are missing from the "XboxGUI" folder

lbl_icn_msg.tga
lbl_icredits.tga
lbl_influ_neg.tga
lbl_influ_pos.tga

These all need packing as TPC then the extension changing to TXB
