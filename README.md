# Expanded Galaxy Port
KotOR : Expanded Galaxy is a port of the first game to the second games version of the engine as well as a mod that adds the planets from the second game and a bunch of fixes / changes / additions.

## Repository folder and file structure
# Folders
Expanded Galaxy Port Installer - the port installer folder containing the source folder and tslpatchdata folder as well as HoloPatcher.

File List Mini Project - a set of file lists which are going to be integrated into the installer in order to pull the majority of the required files from the original games installation in order to reduce the filesize of this project.

Modules Source - contains the level files organised into folders denoting the planet and module names as well as the .mod files themselves, I use this to quickly and easily repack levels.

Saves - the latest common save for testing purposes.

Scripts Left To Decompile - scripts that haven't been decompiled yet exist here.

Texture Overhaul - the beginnings of a set of lists that will eventually be used as a basis for working on a texture overhaul for the project.
