; TSLPATCHER - GENERATED MODIFICATIONS FILE (1/18/2008)
; ===================================================================
; This file is automatically generated and as such has no formatting
; to speak of. You can insert blank lines between sections (but NOT
; between keys within a section!) and add comment lines starting
; with semicolon to make it more readable without breaking anything.
; -------------------------------------------------------------------
; This file was actually hand made for use with HoloPatcher and the Expanded Galaxy Project by Thor110
; Some parts were generated using ChangeEdit and other parts were generated with custom batch scripts
; I've noted this because it contains many examples of using the new features introduced into HoloPatcher
; TSLPatcher does not have a lot of these features and as such I wanted to leave a record here.
