Yavin Station Hangar by WildKarrde included with both parts of the project.

Duplicate TGA files removed that already exist as TPC files.

Template patches created and files included in main patch for the Yavin Station Hangar have been removed from the port patch.

Shaleena now properly goes back to randomly walking after the first dialog in the undercity on Taris.

Bioware and Obsidian intro movies added back to the project and game template patches.

The cutscenes in stunt_12 & stunt_14 with Malak about Calo Nord and Darth Bandon now happen when travelling from planet to planet under the correct conditions.

Patch seemed to be missing updated modules.

Shader Fixes from JCarter426 included with the main part of the project and added to the template.

Ebon Hawk Armband removed from the player while in the Sith Base on Manaan and during the encounter with Calo Nord on Tatooine.

Ebon Hawk Armband removed while in the underwater base on Manaan if the plot hasn't been advanced ( because the player can return there ) and given back to the player during the Selkath Ambush after returning to the surface.

The Ebon Hawk Armband is now added back to your inventory if you come back up from the underwater base early.
