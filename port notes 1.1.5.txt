Yavin Station Hangar by WildKarrde included with both parts of the project.

Duplicate TGA files removed that already exist as TPC files.

Template patches created and files included in main patch for the Yavin Station Hangar have been removed from the port patch.

Shaleena now properly goes back to randomly walking after the first dialog in the undercity on Taris.

Bioware and Obsidian intro movies added back to the project and game template patches.

The cutscenes in stunt_12 & stunt_14 with Malak about Calo Nord and Darth Bandon now happen when travelling from planet to planet under the correct conditions.
