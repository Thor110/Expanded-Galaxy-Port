ebon hawk and taris armbands now return you to the exact location from which you left.

ebo_m41aa - Fixed an issue where the landing on the Starforge could loop forever through the galaxy map.

stunt_44 - Fixed a cutscene that would break due to the original games model height differential scripts.

sta_m45aa - some scripts cleaned up.

stunt_55a - fixed a loop in the darkside ending cutscene of the game and spawned the player back on the Ebon Hawk.
