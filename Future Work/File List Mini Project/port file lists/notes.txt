final txt files exist in kotor 1s files

trimmed txt files exist in kotor 1s files but might not be required

checked txt files are the initial text files generated that I am using as reference to construct these file lists

check later folder is a list of other file types to check over

custom files contain files that are definitely custom or altered


semi-final file lists might need double or triple checking
example : tga files exist in K1 that have been altered specifically for K2 ( such as some GUI textures )
